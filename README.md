# General information
Tasks 

Read tables 

Define attributes for id/coordinates/timestamps/user types/... 

Data cleaning methods 

Extraction of trip durations à easy, we have time stamps 

Extraction of trip distances à method: …. 

Extract information about daily patterns 

 

Timetable:  

By end of April: Get to know GitHub, Read in data, data cleaning 

30.4./2.5.: Calculate trip durations & trip distances à Voronoi approach 

9.5./11.5.: Compare attributes, find patterns (daily, seasonal…) 

21.5. and 23.5.: Statistical assessment of our results, writing report, preparing presentation 

28.5: Interim report and project presentation 

 

Ideas: 

Polygon areas: Count intersections, doing segment intersections, compare polygons between seasons, trip complexity
