#This is the file containing the clas DistanceCalculation. This class is for the calculation of the Manhattan Distance and returns the following: 
# -start latitude and start longitude
# -end latitude and end longitude
# -distance (Manhattan)
# -the coordinates of the line (should always be 3 coordinates -> one is new the other 2 are start and end coordinate)


# Quick addition: I left the correction for the slight offset northward alignment. Looking more closely at the city's road system, I could see that the offset could vary a bit in certain parts of the city.
